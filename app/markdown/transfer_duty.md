Transfer duty (formerly known as stamp duty in NSW) is a tax paid when you purchase or transfer ownership of a property. It must be paid as a lump upfront cost.

Calculating transfer duty can be complicated because it is a progressive tax. This means that you are charged a set fee as well as a percentage of every dollar over each price bracket that the property price falls into. More simply: the more expensive the property is, the more transfer duty you will have to pay.

**First Home Buyer's Assistance Scheme (FHBAS)**

- If you qualify for the FHBAS, you may be entitled to either a full exemption or a concessional rate when paying transfer duty.

**First Home Buyer Choice (FHBC)**

- If you qualify for the FHBC scheme, you can choose to pay an annual property tax instead of transfer duty. This can be beneficial as you can avoid paying transfer duty as a lump sum which can free up more of your savings to use for a deposit.

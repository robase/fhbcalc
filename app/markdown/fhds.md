# Australian Government 5% Deposit Scheme

The Australian Government 5% Deposit Scheme helps home buyers purchase a home sooner with a minimum deposit of just 5% of the property value.

## How it works

With the Scheme, Housing Australia provides a Guarantee to the lender, so home buyers only need a minimum 5% deposit instead of the usual 20%. This helps avoid Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI) and reduces upfront costs.

## Eligibility Criteria

### Personal Circumstances
- **Citizenship**: Must be an Australian citizen or permanent resident
- **Age**: Must be at least 18 years old
- **Deposit**: Minimum 5% of property value (maximum 95% LVR)
- **Property Ownership**: Must be a first home buyer OR not have owned property in Australia in the last 10 years
- **Owner-Occupier**: Must intend to live in the property (investment properties not eligible)
- **Income**: No income cap (unlike First Home Guarantee)

### Property Requirements
- Must be a residential property
- Purchase price must be at or below the price cap for the location
- Can be existing home, house and land package, vacant land with build contract, or off-the-plan

### Price Caps (October 2025)

Both the purchase price and property value (as assessed by your lender) must be at or below the cap. For new builds on vacant land with separate contracts, the combined land price and build costs must stay under the cap.

## Key Features

- **5% Minimum Deposit**: Buy sooner with lower upfront costs
- **No Income Cap**: There is no income limit for this scheme
- **Owner-Occupier Only**: Must live in the property within 6 months and continue living there
- **Principal and Interest Repayments**: Loan must have P&I repayments (limited exceptions for new builds)
- **Loan Term**: Maximum 30 years (plus up to 3 years for building a new home)

## What Changed from the Previous First Home Guarantee?

The Australian Government 5% Deposit Scheme (effective October 1, 2025) replaces the previous First Home Guarantee scheme with the following changes:

**Key Changes:**
- **Removed income caps** - Previously limited to $125,000 (single) or $200,000 (couple)
- **Higher price caps** - Increased limits across most locations
- **Expanded availability** - More properties now qualify under the scheme

This makes the scheme accessible to more Australians, particularly those with higher incomes who were previously excluded.

## Application Process

1. Check eligibility using the Eligibility Tool on firsthomebuyers.gov.au
2. Contact a Participating Lender authorised to offer the Scheme
3. Complete application and provide required documents
4. Receive pre-approval (90 days to find a home)
5. Sign contract of sale
6. Settlement and move in

## Important Notes

- You cannot apply directly to Housing Australia - must apply through a Participating Lender
- The Guarantee remains until the loan is repaid or LVR drops to 80% or below
- If you stop living in the property, the Guarantee may be revoked and you may need to pay LMI
- Can be used alongside other government schemes (except Help to Buy Scheme)

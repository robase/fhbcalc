The amount you will need to pay every month of the loan period. This calculator assumes a fixed-rate mortgage with an interest rate of your choice (default is 6.01%) annually over a 30-year loan period.

**Serviceability Buffer**

This calculator takes into account a **3% serviceability buffer** on top of the loan interest rate. This is a common requirement for most lenders, and is used to ensure you can still afford your loan repayments if interest rates rise.

```
Interest rate with buffer = Interest Rate + Buffer
e.g. 9.81% = 6.81% + 2%
```

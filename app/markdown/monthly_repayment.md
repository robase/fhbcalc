The amount you will need to pay every month of the loan period. This calculator assumes a fixed-rate mortgage with an interest rate of your choice annually over a given loan period. The calculator defaults to a 6.5% interest rate with a 30 year loan period.

**Serviceability Buffer**

This calculator takes into account a **3% serviceability buffer** on top of the loan interest rate. This is a common requirement for most lenders, and is used to ensure you can still afford your loan repayments if interest rates rise.

```
Interest rate with buffer = Interest Rate + Buffer
e.g. 9.5% = 6.5% + 3%
```

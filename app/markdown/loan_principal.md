The amount you will need to borrow to buy a house for the given purchase price.

Calculated as:

```
Loan Amount = Purchase Price - Deposit
```

**Note: LMI Capitalisation**

- This calculator assumes that LMI is being paid in a lump sum as an upfront cost when you first begin your loan.
- Some lenders offer the option to add the cost of LMI to your loan so you can avoid paying it upfront - known as LMI Capitalisation.
- This can be beneficial if you have a low deposit but may cost more as you will be charged interest on the LMI added to your loan principal.

Loan principal calculated with LMI capitalisation:

```
Loan Principal = Purchase Price - Deposit + LMI
```

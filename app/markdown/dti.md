Debt to income ratio (DTI) is a measure of your expenses compared to how much money you make. It is calculated by dividing your total yearly debt payments and living expenses by your before tax income.

#### Expenses

Your expenses are calculated by taking the greater value between your self reported expenses e.g. (hecs repayments + living expenses) and the HEM benchmark for your household type.

The HEM (Household Expenditure Measure) benchmark provides a minimum value for lenders your expected expenses based on your household type i.e. your income, relationship status and number of dependents. This is a guard against under-reporting your expenses to try and increase your borrowing power.

```
expenses = maximum(self reported expenses, HEM measure)

DTI = expenses / income
DTI = (living expenses + hecs repayments) / income
```

#### Borrowing Power

- Different lenders will place different limits on DTI when offering loans as a way to limit their risk exposure to you failing to repay your loan. The higher the DTI of a borrower, the higher the risk.
- To decrease your DTI and increase your borrowing power, you can either reduce your expenses or loan repayments (e.g., cancel a credit card, pay off your HECS), or increase your income.

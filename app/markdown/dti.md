Debt to income ratio (DTI) is a measure of your expenses compared to how much money you make. It is calculated by dividing your total monthly debt payments and living expenses by your gross monthly income.

```
DTI = monthly expenses / monthly income
DTI = (living expenses + monthly hecs) / monthly income
```

#### Borrowing Power

- Different lenders will place different limits on DTI when offering loans as a way to limit their risk exposure to you failing to repay your loan. The higher the DTI of a borrower, the higher the risk.
- To decrease your DTI and increase your borrowing power, you can either reduce your expenses or loan repayments (e.g., cancel a credit card, pay off your HECS), or increase your income.

Lender's Mortgage Insurance (LMI) is an insurance policy that lenders might require you to pay when you take out a home loan. LMI protects the lender in case you're not able to repay your home loan. It is usually required if you have a small deposit i.e. your LVR is greater than 80%.

LMI is calculated based on a set of premiums set by a lender's insurer. These premiums depend on how much you are borrowing and what your LVR is for the loan. Generally speaking, the higher your LVR, the more LMI will cost.

LMI = Purchase Price * LMI premium

LMI premium = function of (LVR, Loan principal)

**Avoiding LMI**

- If you qualify for the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://firsthomebuyers.gov.au">Australian Government 5% Deposit Scheme (FHDS)</a>, the government will act as a guarantor of your home loan and you will not need to pay LMI.

- You can qualify to have LMI waived with some lenders based on your profession - typically legal, medical, and accounting professionals will qualify.

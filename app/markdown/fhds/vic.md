The Australian Government 5% Deposit Scheme helps first home buyers purchase a property with an LVR up to 95% without paying Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI).

This scheme replaced the previous First Home Guarantee in October 2025 with **no income cap**, making it accessible to higher earners.

#### Eligibility

- **No income limit** - A key change from the previous scheme
- You must be an owner-occupier of the purchased property (not buying as an investment)
- Must be a first home buyer OR not have owned property in Australia in the last 10 years
- Must be an Australian citizen or permanent resident
- Minimum 5% deposit of property value
- The property price must be less than:
  - $950,000 if buying in Melbourne or Geelong
  - $650,000 for rest of VIC

#### How it works

Housing Australia provides a Guarantee to your lender, allowing you to buy with just a 5% deposit instead of the usual 20%, avoiding LMI costs.

The Guarantee remains until your loan is repaid or your LVR drops to 80% or below.

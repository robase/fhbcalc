Transfer duty (aka stamp duty) is a tax paid when you purchase or transfer ownership of a property. It must be paid as a lump upfront cost.

Calculating transfer duty can be complicated because it is a progressive tax. This means that you are charged a set fee as well as a percentage of every dollar over each price bracket that the property price falls into. More simply: the more expensive the property is, the more transfer duty you will have to pay.

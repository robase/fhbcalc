Transfer duty (aka stamp duty) is a tax paid when you purchase or transfer ownership of a property. It must be paid as a lump upfront cost.

Calculating transfer duty can be complicated because it is a progressive tax. This means that you are charged a set fee as well as a percentage of every dollar over each price bracket that the property price falls into. More simply: the more expensive the property is, the more transfer duty you will have to pay.

**Transfer Duty Concession or Exemption**

- You may be entitled to either a full exemption or a concessional rate when paying transfer duty.

**Existing Home vs Vacant Land**

- Vacant land purchases are charged at the default rate of transfer duty. Concessions for vacant land are deducted from this amount.
- Existing home purchases are charged at the home concession rate of transfer duty. FHB concessions for existing homes are deducted from this amount.
